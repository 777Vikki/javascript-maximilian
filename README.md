What is JavaScript?
    1. JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine (“host environment”).

    2. JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a page directly from inside the browser). Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to the popularity of Java, it was renamed to JavaScript.

    3. JavaScript is totally independent from Java and has nothing in common with Java!
